    overview: "A revolutionary augmented reality tool designed to streamline the aircraft inspection process, allowing technicians to visualize and log damage directly on the airframe.",
    problem: "Manual inspection of aircraft damage was slow, prone to error, and required extensive documentation. Technicians had to cross-reference 2D manuals with 3D structures, leading to cognitive load and potential safety risks.",
    solution: "Developed an AR application overlaying digital damage reports directly onto physical aircraft components. The app uses markerless tracking to anchor digital annotations to the fuselage, enabling hands-free data entry and real-time synchronization with the maintenance database.",
    impact: "Reduced inspection time by 40% and improved reporting accuracy by 95%. The solution was rolled out to 3 major maintenance hubs, saving an estimated $2M annually in operational costs.",

    overview: "An indoor navigation system for large-scale manufacturing facilities, guiding technicians to specific machinery and points of interest with centimeter-level accuracy.",
    problem: "Navigating complex factory floors and locating specific machinery for maintenance was inefficient for new technicians. GPS signals are unreliable indoors, and static maps fail to account for dynamic floor layouts.",
    solution: "Implemented an AR indoor navigation system with turn-by-turn directions and POI overlays. Leveraged visual positioning systems (VPS) and digital twins to create a persistent AR cloud layer over the factory floor.",
    impact: "Decreased onboarding time for maintenance staff by 60% and optimized workflow efficiency. The system reduced average time-to-locate-asset from 15 minutes to 3 minutes.",
